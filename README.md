# Creditcard Fraud Prediction 
How everyday businesses, customers and clients can be mindful of everday fraud that happens.

# Description 
The main purpose of this project is to edcuate customers of any bank in America that fraud can happen. It is best to understand the metrics behind them. For our purpose we will be using the **fraud_test.csv file** to explore the insight behind it. **We will be mainly analyzing the following questions:**

-What time is fraud occurring more at (morning or night).
-Amount of fraud based on geography.
-Average age of creditcard fraud viticm.
-The highest number of fraud occuring in each category
-The fraud per merchant. 

# Getting Started
**Dependencies:**

import pandas as pd

import plotly.express as px

from IPython.display import Image, display

import scipy.stats as stats

import requests

import json

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
Windows 10 or 11

# Installing 
Download should be done from main file.
Ideally file opening should be done from ("Resources/fraud_test") or clean_data.

# Executing the program 
Step-by-step bullets

# Help
Time analysis seems to crash after running the last command on plotly (sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't).
